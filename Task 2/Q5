NAVIGATION:-
The sensors used in navigation include.

    -> Inertial sensors comprising accelerometer and gyroscopes.
    -> Visual sensors suchas LIDA , RGBD cam, conventional color camera, etc.
There can aslo be linear or rotary actuators on which the cisual sensors can be mounted for better localisation and mapping, by moving the range of vision.


MOBILITY AND POWER:- 
Examples --> Wheel pulse encoder, microwave sensor.


ROBOTIC ARM:-
    -> Visual sensor through which affects the motion plan of the robotic arm.
    -> Force torque sensors to detect the amount of force being provided.
    -> Additionally thermal sensors can be addded.
