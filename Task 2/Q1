The main mechanism used by ROS nodes to communicate is by sending and receiving messages. The messages are organised
into specific categories called topics. Nodes may publish messages on a particular topic or subscribe to a topic receive 
information.

Sending of the data by the node is referred to as publishing the message.

Receiving of the data by the ROS node is termed as subscribing to a topic.
